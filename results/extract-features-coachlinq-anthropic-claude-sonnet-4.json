    "data": "Based on my analysis of the transcript and PDF documents, here are the features to be built for the CoachLinq project:\n\n## Core Chatbot Features\n\n### 1. AI Health Coaching Chatbot\n**Description**: An AI-powered conversational agent designed specifically for health coaching that provides personalized, evidence-based insights to patients. The bot will be built around NBHWC (National Board for Health and Wellness Coaching) standards, motivational interviewing techniques, and behavioral science models. It will handle patient interactions for conditions initially focused on sleep medicine and obesity.\n\n### 2. Escalation and De-escalation System\n**Description**: A smart routing system that can escalate conversations from the AI bot to human health coaches when needed, and de-escalate from human coaches back to the bot. The system will create tasks for human coaches within the EMR system, provide summaries of bot interactions, and allow coaches to take action before routing back to the bot.\n\n### 3. Clinical Insights Generation Engine\n**Description**: An AI system that analyzes data from EMR/EHR systems to generate clinical insights. For sleep medicine, this includes analyzing CPAP usage data and other medical device usage patterns. For obesity, this involves analyzing nutrition tracking and lifestyle data. The engine will learn from patient interactions and medical device data to drive personalized lifestyle-based prompts.\n\n## Integration Features\n\n### 4. EMR/EHR System Integration\n**Description**: Integration capability with Electronic Medical Records and Electronic Health Records systems, starting with Practice Better EMR. The integration will pull patient data, track food intake, educational interactions, and conversation history with human health coaches to inform the AI bot's responses.\n\n### 5. Medical Device Data Integration\n**Description**: Integration with medical devices to pull usage data, particularly CPAP machines for sleep apnea patients and other remote patient monitoring devices. This data will be used to generate insights and drive personalized coaching interventions.\n\n## User Interface Features\n\n### 6. Dual-Facing Interface System\n**Description**: A comprehensive interface system that serves both patients and health coaches. Patients receive conversational behavior support and education through a chat interface, while coaches access real-time dashboards with risk alerts, behavioral trend summaries, and AI-generated intervention recommendations.\n\n### 7. Coach Dashboard with Clinical Decision Support\n**Description**: A dashboard interface for health coaches that provides intelligent decision support, risk flagging, escalation alerts, and performance insights. The dashboard will help coaches manage multiple patients efficiently while maintaining clinical quality.\n\n### 8. Patient Chat Interface\n**Description**: A user-friendly chat interface for patients to interact with the AI health coach, receive personalized guidance, track progress, set reminders, and access educational content related to their health conditions.\n\n## Supporting Features\n\n### 9. Sandbox EMR for Demo\n**Description**: A dummy EMR interface for demonstration and testing purposes that includes fake patient data, task management, and basic EMR functionality. This will be used for proof-of-concept demonstrations to investors and stakeholders without requiring HIPAA compliance.\n\n### 10. HIPAA Compliance Framework\n**Description**: A technical framework that can be implemented to make the system HIPAA compliant for production use. This includes proper authorization, authentication, access trails, audit logs, and secure data handling protocols.\n\n### 11. Learning and Feedback System\n**Description**: A system that enables continuous learning and improvement of the AI bot through feedback from human health coaches. This includes the integration with the \"inhealth Academy\" for model training and quality assurance.\n\n## Reporting and Analytics Features\n\n### 12. KPI Tracking and Reporting Dashboard\n**Description**: A comprehensive reporting system that tracks key performance indicators including patient engagement metrics, escalation accuracy, coach satisfaction scores, and clinical outcomes. The dashboard will provide insights for both operational management and clinical quality improvement.\n\n### 13. Clinical Outcomes Tracking\n**Description**: A system to track and analyze clinical outcomes and behavior change metrics, linking engagement patterns with downstream biometrics for continuous validation and optimization of care pathways.\n\n## Design and Mockup Features\n\n### 14. Future State Mockups and Roadmap Visualization\n**Description**: Design mockups and prototypes that show the evolution and future capabilities of the platform. These will be used for investor presentations and strategic planning, demonstrating the long-term vision for multi-condition support, advanced integrations, and expanded functionality.\n\nAll features are designed to work together as an integrated platform that can initially function as a proof-of-concept for fundraising purposes, with the capability to scale into a full production system with proper clinical compliance and multi-organizational deployment."
