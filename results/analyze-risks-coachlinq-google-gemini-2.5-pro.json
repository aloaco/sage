          "description": "The current plan is to build a non-HIPAA compliant Proof-of-Concept (PoC) with the intention of making it compliant later. Retrofitting HIPAA compliance is notoriously complex and often requires significant architectural changes, not just 'swapping' infrastructure. This approach risks creating a PoC whose architecture is fundamentally unsuitable for a production healthcare environment.",
          "id": "risk-001",
          "impact": "Major delays, budget overruns, and a potential need for a complete rewrite when moving from PoC to a production-ready product. The initial PoC investment may not be fully leverageable.",
          "mitigation": "Design the PoC architecture with HIPAA compliance as a core principle, even if not fully implemented. Use HIPAA-eligible cloud services from the start. Create and present a clear technical roadmap detailing the specific steps, architectural changes, and effort required to achieve full HIPAA compliance post-funding.",

          "description": "The AI bot is intended to be a 'credible health resource' and eventually 'board certified'. Generative AI models (LLMs) are prone to 'hallucination' â€“ generating plausible but incorrect or fabricated information. In a medical context, this could lead to providing harmful advice.",
          "id": "risk-002",
          "impact": "Erosion of user and investor trust, significant patient safety and liability risks, and failure to meet the core product goal of being a credible clinical tool. This could jeopardize the entire venture.",
          "mitigation": "Implement a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to ground the AI's responses in a curated, approved knowledge base (e.g., NBHWC standards, clinical guidelines). Develop strict prompt engineering guardrails and output parsers to constrain the bot's responses. The 'Continuous Learning System' (feat-004) should be leveraged early to flag and correct inaccuracies.",

          "description": "The project documents suggest a 4-6 week timeline for the Phase 1 MVP. Given the requirements for a conversational AI, a mocked escalation workflow, and a 'sandbox EMR' interface, this timeline is extremely aggressive and likely does not account for unforeseen technical challenges or testing cycles.",
          "id": "risk-003",
          "impact": "Delivery of a rushed, low-quality, and buggy PoC that fails to function reliably during investor pitches. This could result in a failure to secure the necessary seed funding.",
          "mitigation": "Break down the MVP development into a realistic, phased timeline. Clearly define what constitutes the 'minimum viable demo' for the initial pitch. Focus on perfecting a few 'happy path' scenarios (e.g., the specific Apnimed use case) rather than building a broadly functional but fragile system.",

          "category": "timeline",
          "description": "The meeting transcript reveals client indecision regarding key PoC features, such as integrating with a real EMR versus a dummy database. The request to see options 'side by side' before committing indicates that the scope is not firmly defined, which can lead to scope creep as new ideas emerge during development.",
          "id": "risk-004",
          "impact": "Timeline delays, budget overruns, and a diluted focus that results in a PoC that does many things poorly rather than a few things exceptionally well.",
          "mitigation": "Lock in the scope for Phase 1 immediately after this meeting. Document and get client sign-off on the specific features and limitations of the MVP. Establish a formal change request process for any scope modifications.",
