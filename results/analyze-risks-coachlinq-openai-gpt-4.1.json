          "title": "Practice Better EMR Integration Uncertainty",
          "description": "The MVP requires integration with the Practice Better EMR, but it is unclear if their API is fully documented, stable, or if the team has prior experience with it. If the Practice Better API is limited, undocumented, or changes unexpectedly, the integration could be delayed or require significant rework.",
          "severity": "high",
          "category": "technical",
          "impact": "Could delay core MVP delivery, as integration is central to all chatbot features and escalation workflows.",
          "mitigation": "Engage with Practice Better's technical team early. Build a proof-of-concept integration as soon as possible. Prepare a fallback plan using a dummy EMR or local database in case integration proves infeasible within the MVP timeline."

        {
          "id": "tech-002",
          "title": "HIPAA Compliance/Non-Compliance Decision Risk",
          "description": "The project intends for the MVP to be non-HIPAA compliant to reduce development time and complexity, but future integration and eventual deployment will require HIPAA compliance. There is a risk that architectural shortcuts taken for the MVP will make it costly or difficult to retrofit compliance later.",
          "severity": "medium",
          "category": "technical",
          "impact": "Could lead to significant rework or delays post-MVP, increasing technical debt and impacting investor confidence.",
          "mitigation": "Design the MVP architecture with HIPAA compliance in mind even if not implementing full compliance now (e.g., modular authentication, clear data boundaries, audit logging hooks). Document a clear upgrade path and ensure all sensitive data handling is easily refactorable."
        },
        {
          "id": "tech-003",
          "title": "LLM Hallucination and Stability",
          "description": "The use of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for clinical insight generation and patient interaction brings risk of model hallucination, inconsistent outputs, and potential for unsafe or misleading recommendations, especially in a clinical context.",
          "severity": "high",
          "category": "technical",
          "impact": "Could harm user trust, endanger patient safety, or result in negative pilot outcomes, especially if the LLM generates incorrect health advice.",
          "mitigation": "Constrain model outputs with rule-based checks, curate 'happy path' demos for MVP pitches, perform rigorous QA on sample conversations, and set clear user expectations. Plan for rapid patching as bugs or unsafe outputs are reported."
        },
        {
          "id": "tech-004",
          "title": "Escalation/De-escalation Workflow Complexity",
          "description": "The human-in-the-loop escalation feature is a key differentiator but requires robust workflow logic, task tracking, and communication between bot, coach, and EMR. This introduces both technical and coordination complexity, especially if integrating with EMR tasks or notifications.",
          "severity": "medium",
          "category": "technical",
          "impact": "If not implemented correctly, escalations may be missed, delayed, or not properly reflected to users/investors, undermining a core MVP promise.",
          "mitigation": "Prototype escalation with a simple, sandboxed interface first. Rigorously test edge cases (missed escalations, duplicate tasks). Ensure clear logging and tracking of escalation events for demo and QA purposes."
        },
        {
          "id": "tech-005",
          "title": "Clinical Insight Engine Data Dependencies",
          "description": "The insight engine aims to synthesize multiple data sources (biometrics, patient-reported outcomes, device data). For the MVP, this may rely on simulated or limited real data. Future expansion will depend on robust, real-time data pipelines, which may not be trivial to establish or maintain.",
          "severity": "medium",
          "category": "technical",
          "impact": "MVP may be limited in demonstrating real-world capabilities, and future scalability could be hampered by data integration challenges.",
          "mitigation": "For MVP, clearly scope data sources (use static/simulated data if needed), but design interfaces to allow for plug-and-play integration with real-world APIs later. Document required data formats and partner integration needs early."
        },
        {
          "id": "timeline-001",
          "title": "Aggressive MVP Timeline (4–6 Weeks)",
          "description": "The proposed MVP delivery window is 4–6 weeks, which is ambitious given the number of high-priority, technically complex features (EMR integration, chatbot, reporting dashboard, escalation workflows). Any slippage could delay investor pitches and grant applications.",
          "severity": "high",
          "category": "timeline",
          "impact": "Delays could push back funding opportunities, reduce team momentum, and risk missing windows for grant submission or investor engagement.",
          "mitigation": "Adopt a strict MVP feature prioritization. Focus on 'happy path' demos and core flows. Hold weekly check-ins to assess progress. Prepare clear communication for stakeholders if scope or timeline needs to be adjusted. Consider parallelizing design and engineering efforts."

        {
          "id": "timeline-002",
          "title": "External Partner Dependence (inhealth, Device Vendors)",
          "description": "The MVP and future pilots depend on collaboration with inhealth (for clinical validation, QA) and third-party device vendors (e.g., Wesper, Apnimed) for data and integration. Any delays or changes in partner engagement could stall validation or disrupt planned pilots.",
          "severity": "medium",
          "category": "timeline",
          "impact": "Could delay usability testing, pilot deployments, or access to live data, undermining the evidence needed for funding rounds.",
          "mitigation": "Formalize partner agreements where possible. Set clear expectations and timelines with partners. Have contingency plans for simulated data/testing if real-world integrations are delayed."

          "id": "resource-001",
          "title": "Skill Gaps in Deep EMR Integration and Compliance",
          "description": "The team is experienced in health coaching and AI, but deep integration with EMR/EHR systems and eventual HIPAA compliance require specialized knowledge (e.g., HL7, FHIR, healthcare security).",
          "severity": "medium",
          "category": "resource",
          "impact": "Gaps in EMR integration or compliance expertise could cause delays, integration failures, or security oversights.",
          "mitigation": "Engage a consultant or hire a contractor with direct EMR/EHR integration experience early. Leverage open-source or commercial libraries for HL7/FHIR. Plan for a HIPAA compliance audit before scaling beyond MVP."
        },
        {
          "id": "resource-002",
          "title": "Limited Initial Funding and Resource Constraints",
          "description": "The MVP is founder-funded with a minimal budget. There is pressure to keep costs low while delivering a robust, demo-ready product. If unexpected technical challenges arise, there may be insufficient runway to address them without additional funding.",
          "severity": "high",
          "category": "resource",
          "impact": "Could result in feature cuts, lower quality, or inability to deliver a compelling MVP for investor pitches.",
          "mitigation": "Prioritize features ruthlessly for MVP. Identify lowest-cost, highest-impact approaches (e.g., use open-source tools, avoid over-engineering). Be transparent with stakeholders about what is achievable within budget and what will require further funding."
        },
        {
          "id": "resource-003",
          "title": "Reliance on Third-Party APIs and Model Providers",
          "description": "Dependence on external APIs (Practice Better, LLM providers like OpenAI or Anthropic) introduces the risk of API changes, pricing shifts, or service outages outside the team's control.",
          "severity": "medium",
          "category": "resource",
          "impact": "Unexpected changes could break core functionality or increase costs, impacting demos or future operational expenses.",
          "mitigation": "Monitor API change logs. Abstract external API interactions to allow for rapid switching if needed. Track usage and set budget alerts for third-party services. Consider backup providers or local fallback models for critical flows."
